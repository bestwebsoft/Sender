= How can i make sure that the subscriber has read my letter? =

This function will be added in the stable version of plugin.

= Why are my letters sent so long =

For sending letters in plugin used wp_cron - Wordpress function for periodic execution of any planned actions. This function depends on the traffic of your site: the more visitors, the faster the letters will be sent.

= Why am I unable to send letters to all users at the same time? =

1. Simultaneous sending of a large number of messages can slow down your site.
2. Your site can be identified as a source of spamming, which can lead to blocking of your website or hosting-account.

Try to deactivate and activate the version you want to use (either free or PRO).
